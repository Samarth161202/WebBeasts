Description
As we know that farmers dont get the desired  price for their products. So, to get rid of this problem, we have created a web portal to give appropriate price to farmers products. So, now i will show you the welcome page of our shopyfarm website, on the front page of our site we have added attractive blocks to make our interface more user friendly and on the home page we have added some hyperlinks so, users can directly jump on the shopyfarm products page. As this is a prototype website we have added dummy products on the product page.

If you want to become a vendor then you'll need to register as a vendor on Shopyfarm. On login page you have to select my account option then click on I am a vendor option fill the details and then register. But we have already created a account as a vendor so we will directly login into the account. After completing the registration process, we'll provide you a vendor's dashboard where you'll be able to see your monthly sale, order details, products details, withdraw and many there are four options on vendors dashboard
